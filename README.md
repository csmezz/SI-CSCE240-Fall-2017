This GitHub repository is designed to be a resource for coding examples, helpful information regarding homeworks, and other information that can be gathered to make more sense of C++ and the software engineering process.

Things to note about my coding examples:
- I will be following the Google C++ Style Guide so that my code is legible and understandable for everyone. (included in the "Styling" section)
- I will provide both internal and external documentation for all of my coding projects, since my code is public.
