CSCE 240 Fall 2017 -- Supplemental Instruction Code for Students

For the time being, this repository will serve as a separate resource for CSCE 145 students to learn the basics of C++.

I will try to keep this repository updated through the Summer in preparation for SI'ing CSCE 240 in the Fall, however, you may email me at judsonj@email.sc.edu if you have any questions regarding the code.
